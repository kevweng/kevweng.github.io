<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong></p>

<p><em>1. Go to the library</em></p>

<p><em>2. Less consuming, more creating</em></p>

<p><em>3.  Rest and Repeat</em></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="go-to-the-library">Go to the library</h2>

<p>My first suggestion if you feel like you aren’t getting anything done is to <strong>go to the library</strong>. Actually just go. If working is too scary right now, just go and sit there. Because unlike in your home, your bed, TV, snacks, and other distractions aren’t readily available at the library. Your environment greatly affects your ability to clear your mind and get down to business. Just going to the library and <em>being</em> there is conducive to productivity because everyone is there to work, learn, or read.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Office buildings were made so that people have a designated place to work, separate from their life at home.  The library is a million times better.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://github.com/kevweng/academic-kickstart/blob/master/static/How%20to%20be%20Productive/library.jpeg?raw=true" alt="" /></p>

<p>As a disclaimer, going to the library will include forfeiting a portion of your social life. However, you’ll see people who are smarter and work harder than you. Be friends with them, especially if you’re a student. You’ll see people you never expected to see there. People will be getting tutored, others will be jotting down notes from textbooks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Try to get a study room. You’ll need a library card, and if you don’t have one yet, get one! You’re paying taxes for it anyway.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even if you’re by yourself, most libraries will give you the study room for yourself and you can get <em>upwards of three to four hours alone</em> or until a group takes precedence.</p>

<p>A change in environment does not always have to be a library if it’s not convenient. Cafe-hopping is also a popular way to regularly switch up your surroundings. I would still encourage those that don’t like the ambient noise to choose the library.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/kevweng/academic-kickstart/blob/master/static/How%20to%20be%20Productive/coffee.jpeg?raw=true" alt="" /></p>

<p>I support getting a drink every time you manage to force yourself to go outside of your home to work. I feel like giving yourself small rewards is an incentive to be productive more often, and gives you a non-distracting stimulus while you’re working. I suggest coffee, tea, water, or something else low in sugar. Limit these to one per day.</p>

<p>Once you’ve gone to the library, then you can move onto the second tip.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="less-consuming-more-creating">Less consuming, more creating</h2>

<p>At some point, you’ve googled, “how to be productive”, and have arrived at some clickbait BS, and before you know it, you have twenty tabs open, each detailing some app,  fad, or other nonsense that doesn’t work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Researching how to be productive is not productive</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although it is hypocritical that I’m writing about this, I know that the “buzzword” that is productivity will have those of you making this mistake flock to this post.</p>

<p>This is why I only have three tips in this post. Although it is great to be organized and have every hour of the day blocked and scheduled, its most common for people to try and use the planning process as a means of procrastination. I know this is true, because I used to do it. I used to nitpick the differences between Evernote and Bear, how to use notecards and spreadsheets most optimally, and in the end, no one cares.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/kevweng/academic-kickstart/blob/master/static/How%20to%20be%20Productive/notes.jpeg?raw=true" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Absolutely no one cares</strong> if you use Evernote, or Google Keep, or the Notes app. I ended up choosing Bear because I think the bear is cuter than the elephant on Evernote.</p>

<p>I used to watch videos at twice the speed because I was doing MOOCs and watching YouTube to learn things; I also read it somewhere as a productivity tip. In the end, speeding up the video was only giving me the facade of being productive when in fact, everything went in one ear and out the other. If you learn best from an inaudible slur of noise, then I concede. But as of now, I find that the entire video format is not an efficient nor optimal way for me to learn.</p>

<p>My previous anecdote points out a major issue in our understanding of productivity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>We intake too much information. Our signal to noise ratio is so low that we essentially waste our time, but still think we’re being productive.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="rhttps://github.com/kevweng/academic-kickstart/blob/master/static/How%20to%20be%20Productive/news.jpeg?raw=true" alt="" /></p>

<p>Personally, I stopped reading the news. Your mileage may vary depending on how relevant the news is to your work. I gained absolutely nothing relevant from hearing about Elon Musk’s flamethrowers or an oil spill on the other side of the planet. Reading the news seems like a mature thing to do, yet for a lot of people, it is just another time and attention sink.</p>

<p>It is important to limit the consumption of information and focus on creating new work. It doesn’t matter whether you’re writing books or software, taking photos, or filming a movie, you should be doing work you can call your own.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="rest-and-repeat">Rest and Repeat</h2>

<p>My last tip is to rest make sure you get enough rest.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>There was recently an article about Elon Musk, stating that he was often found asleep under tables or chairs. This is not the best way to be productive. He has the ulterior motive of showing solidarity for the workers he is pushing to extreme limits.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everyone needs sleep, and rest, and a refresher. It is impossible to be working optimally for five hours straight so don’t even try. Breaks are necessary.  The Pomodoro Method is a popular choice for balancing work and breaks.</p>

<p>The body and mind both need to be reset frequently to maintain a consistently high level of functionality. Your physical health precedes your mental health, so it’s important to exercise everyday and eat healthy. Both will affect your ability to work and not feel like death in the morning. For mental health, I suggest reflecting regularly and thinking about where you could’ve done better.</p>

<p>I say that these tips should be repeated because consistency is important. The hardest part of working is in the days after your initial high of motivation fades, and you question why you should get out of bed to go to the library. Habits are one of the most important things in being productive.  The brain always prefers a consistent stimulus over a sudden influx of information.</p>

<hr />

<p>I hope this post will help in getting some of you to start working and have a new insight to what productivity means. Don’t be lenient, and hold yourself accountable.</p>
